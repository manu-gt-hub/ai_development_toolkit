       "- The original code was corrected for PEP 8 style compliance and redundancy. Functions were extracted from the single function to enhance modularity and reusability.\n",
       "- All functions now include specific docstrings compliant with PEP 257. Detailed unit tests for each function have been added to ensure results are as expected, fulfilling the necessity of unittests.\n",
       "- Each function now operates as a part of the data processing pipeline, which is more efficient and cleaner.\n",
       "- Comments explaining the functionality were added before complex logic actions to clarify their intentions.\n",
       "- ImportError and numpy redundancies were resolved, ensuring no modules are imported multiple times.\n",
       "- Exception handling wasn't explicitly added because the operations are intrinsically safe with given correct input data; however, working on heterogeneous input might require such handling which should be managed by the caller.\n",
       "- Comprehensive unittesting ensures functionality can be validated independently."
